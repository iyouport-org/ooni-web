This is the technical report on the politically motivated censorship going on
in Bethlehem, West Bank.

These are the networks in question:

    inetnum:         82.205.96.0 - 82.205.103.255
    netname:         GZ-HOME-BR1
    descr:           GAZA BSA HOME
    country:         PS
    admin-c:         WK4085-RIPE
    tech-c:          HT1472-RIPE
    status:          ASSIGNED PA
    mnt-by:          Palnet-mnt
    source:          RIPE # Filtered

    inetnum:         212.106.88.0 - 212.106.95.255
    netname:         RA-HM-ASR-02
    descr:           Hadara Ramallah BSA
    country:         PS
    admin-c:         WK4085-RIPE
    tech-c:          HT1472-RIPE
    status:          Assigned PA
    mnt-by:          Palnet-MNT
    source:          RIPE # Filtered

The technique being used to restrict access to content is a transparent HTTP
proxy. What this does is intercept every HTTP request being made and process it
internally. If the content is cached it will serve the cached version of the
content. If the content is to be blocked it will serve a blocked page.

We developed a test that opens a connection on port 80 towards a known
unrestricted host. Keep in mind that it's irrelevant to what destination the
connection is opened because the transparent HTTP proxy will intercept all HTTP
requests, meaning that all clients are in reality always only speaking to the proxy.
Once we have a connection open we do HTTP GET requests with a changed Host header field.
If the result is the block page then the content is restricted.

We have identified two different block pages that were interchanged at a
certain point during our tests:

### First block page

    HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden
    Server: squid
    Date: Wed, 11 Apr 2012 05:47:10 GMT
    Content-Type: text/html
    Content-Length: 21
    Connection: close

    Sorry, Access Denied

### Second block page

    HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden
    Server: squid
    Date: Sun, 22 Apr 2012 20:55:34 GMT
    Content-Type: text/html
    Content-Length: 2205
    Connection: close

From the response headers of a blocked page we are able to learn that the
software being used is Squid.

We scanned more than 1 million hostnames and only detected censorship on 8 of
these.
The full scan results are available in an unredacted from [here](/post/hadara-palestine/hadara_palestine.yamlooni.tar.gz)

At a certain point we decided to go for a high level of parallelism and not
care about timeout errors. This is because the transparent HTTP proxy is
intercepting our request and making them for us. This means that if a
certain hostname is to be blocked it will reply with the block page
instantenously without processing it. If the site is in the blocklist a
connection attempt to it will never timeout.

What this means, though, is that sites blocked with some more sophisticated
techniques would not have been detected. Though by seeing the kind of setup
that was deployed in this case we find it unlikely that access to content
would be restricted with some more advanced setup and that they would be
using a mix between squid transparent HTTP proxy censorship and other.

The sites whose access is being restricted access to are:

* pal-home.net

* kofiapress.com

* amad.ps

* inlightpress.com

* fpnp.net

* fateh-voice.ps

* karamapress.com

* milad.ps
